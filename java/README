Run

	make

to compile.

Run

	java Gui
	java JdbcExample

etc. to run.

For JDBC, install libmysql-java 

	* Ubuntu Linux (other distros may be similar)

        Go to https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/ to download the package and install it.

	- on older Ubuntu installs, the following may work.

	   sudo apt install libmysql-java


	* OSX / windows
	
	1. download from https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/

	2. follow instructions in 

	https://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-j/en/connector-j-installing.html

Once the JDBC mysql connector is installed, run the following in your shell:

	export CLASSPATH=$CLASSPATH:/usr/share/java/mysql-connector-java.jar
	
	or

	export CLASSPATH=$CLASSPATH:/usr/share/java/mysql-connector-java-8.0.26.jar 
	(replace the version number 8.0.26 with your specific version)


If it runs but you get an error, trying disabling SSL, by changing the DB_URL definition to include useSSL=false.

	static final String DB_URL = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306?useSSL=false";
